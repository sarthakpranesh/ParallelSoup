# ParallelSoup
A library that utilizes BeautifulSoup to provide multi threaded scrapping, reducing the total time involved in the scrapping process

<br />

## Aim
The library should implement the following affectively: (this list can be extended in future):
* Parallelization (I mean duh, you didn't see the repo name or what...)
* Should have a generic interface that maps to beautiful soup
* All parts of the library should be documented heavily
* All parts of the library should have unit tests written for verification of their functionality
* Showcase written examples for different sorts of scrapping

<br />
